Genome Assembly/Alignment:

    FASTQ sequence read files were quality control checked using FASTQC
    Sequence reads were assembled into a de Brujin graph, using velvet advisor and SPAdes.
    Assembly was evaluated using QUAST to find N25, N50 and N75 statistics
    Genome was aligned using Burrows-Wheeler Transform, by converting SAM files to BAM files.



Gene Expression Analysis:

    Expression data analysed using Bioconductor and DESeq2 modules in R.
    Dispersion (gene wise measure of gene variance count data) were estiamted and MA-plot was produced.
    Sample distance calculations and Principla Components Analysis (PCA) was conducted.
    Heat map was generated to visualise the Euclidean distances between samples using gplot R module.
    The genome was anotated using Prokka and the PLSDB plasmid database.
